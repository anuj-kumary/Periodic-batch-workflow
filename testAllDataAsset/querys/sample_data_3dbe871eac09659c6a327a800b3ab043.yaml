      \ table contains one row per customer. It includes historical metrics (such\
      \ as the total amount that each customer has spent in your store) as well as\
      \ forward-looking metrics (such as the predicted number of days between future\
      \ orders and the expected order value in the next 30 days). This table also\
      \ includes columns that segment customers into various categories (such as new,\
      \ returning, promising, at risk, dormant, and loyal), which you can use to target\
      \ marketing activities."

description: "A type of time deposit account, generally insured by the FDIC at banks\
  \ and the NCUA at credit unions, where customers can put their savings to earn a\
  \ yield. There are many types of CDs, but most require that you lock up your money\
  \ for a minimum term, such as six months or one year. The APY that you can earn\
  \ on a CD depends on the bank, the term and other factors."

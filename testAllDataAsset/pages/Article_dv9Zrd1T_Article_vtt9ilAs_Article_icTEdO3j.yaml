description: "<p>OpenMetadata simplifies data discovery with the following strategies.</p><h2><strong>Search</strong></h2><p>Search\
  \ is at the front and center of OpenMetadata and is available in the top Menu bar\
  \ across all the different pages. Users can also start searching by invoking the\
  \ Keyboard shortcut Ctrl + K in Windows or Cmd + K in Mac OS.</p><p>The Search APIs\
  \ are backed by Elasticsearch.</p><h2>Keyword Search</h2><p>A simple yet powerful\
  \ way to find assets by typing the name or description from the search interface.\
  \ The search suggest will display matching data assets in several categories. Your\
  \ query will retrieve all matching tables, topics, dashboards, pipelines, ML models,\
  \ containers, glossaries, and tags. Your queries will match names for data assets\
  \ and their components, such as column names for tables and chart names for dashboards.\
  \ The queries will also match the descriptions used.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/kw.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Keyword Search\"></p><p>Keyword Search</p><h2>Quick Filters</h2><p>Multiple\
  \ quick filter options further help to narrow down the search by <strong>Owner,\
  \ Tag, Tier, Service, Service Type</strong>, and other filters relevant to the type\
  \ of data asset like <strong>Database, Schema, Columns</strong>. You can also search\
  \ by deleted data assets.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/kw2.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Filter using Multiple Parameters\"></p><p>Filter using Multiple Parameters</p><h2>Filter\
  \ by the Type of Data Asset</h2><p>The search results can be narrowed down by data\
  \ assets such as Table, Topic, Dashboard, Pipeline, ML Model, Container, Glossary,\
  \ or Tag.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/da1.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Filter by the Type of Data Asset\"></p><p>Filter by the Type of Data Asset</p><p>Users\
  \ can navigate to the Explore page for specific type of data assets and use the\
  \ filter options relevant to that data asset to narrow down the search.</p><h2>Filter\
  \ by Asset Owner</h2><p>A team or a user can own the data asset in OpenMetadata.\
  \ Users can filter data assets by the asset owner. With information on the data\
  \ asset owners, you can direct your questions to the right person or team.</p><p><img\

  \ alt=\"Filter by Asset Owner\"></p><p>Filter by Asset Owner</p><h2>Filter by Database</h2><p>When\
  \ searching while you are in a database page, you can narrow down your search to\
  \ within the database or to include the overall search results within OpenMetadata.</p><p><img\
  \ src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/db.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Filter by Database\"></p><p>Filter by Database</p><h2>Filter based on Importance:\
  \ Tiers</h2><p>Using tiers, you can search for data based on importance.</p><p><img\

  \ alt=\"Filter based on Importance using Tiers\"></p><p>Filter based on Importance\
  \ using Tiers</p><h2>Filter based on Importance: Usage</h2><p>OpenMetadata captures\
  \ usage profiles for tables during metadata/profiler ingestion. This helps to learn\
  \ how other data consumers are using the tables. You can use the quick filter to\
  \ narrow down the search results by relevance by clicking on the down arrow on the\
  \ top right of the Explore page. You can search for data by:</p><ul class=\"om-list-disc\"\
  ><li class=\"om-leading-normal\"><p><strong>Last Updated</strong> - Filter data\
  \ by the recent updates and changes.</p></li><li class=\"om-leading-normal\"><p><strong>Weekly\
  \ Usage</strong> - Based on the data asset usage metrics.</p></li><li class=\"om-leading-normal\"\
  ><p><strong>Relevance</strong></p></li></ul><p>These details are based on the usage\
  \ summary computations. Further, you can <strong>sort</strong> the results by ascending\
  \ and descending order.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/usage.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Filter based on Importance: Usage\"></p><p>Filter based on Importance: Usage</p><h2>Discover\
  \ Data through Association</h2><p>OpenMetadata provides the links to the frequently\
  \ joined tables and columns as measured by the data profiler. You can also discover\
  \ assets through relationships based on data lineage.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/fjt.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Frequently Joined Tables\"></p><p>Frequently Joined Tables</p><h2>Discover\
  \ Assets through Relationships</h2><p>OpenMetadata helps to locate assets of interest\
  \ by tracing data lineage. You can view the upstream and downstream nodes to discover\
  \ the sources of data and learn about the tables, pipelines, and more. The table\
  \ and column descriptions help to decide if the data is helpful for your use case.\
  \ Similarly, the pipeline description helps to uncover the transformation and more\
  \ data of interest.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/lineage.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Discover Assets through Relationships: Lineage\"></p><p>Discover Assets\
  \ through Relationships: Lineage</p><h2>Advanced Search</h2><p>Users can find data\
  \ assets matching strict criteria by multiple parameters on metadata properties,\
  \ using the <strong>syntax editor</strong> with and/or conditions. Advanced search\
  \ in OpenMetadata supports Boolean operators and faceted queries to search for specific\
  \ facets of your data. Separate advanced search options are available for Tables,\
  \ Topics, Dashboards, Pipelines, ML Models, Containers, Glossary, and Tags.</p><p><img\
  \ src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/data-discovery.gif\"\
  ></p><h2>Discover Data Evolution</h2><p>By viewing lineage and metadata versioning,\
  \ users can discover the data evolution of data assets.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/version.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Discover Data Evolution: Version History\"></p><p>Discover Data Evolution:\
  \ Version History</p><h2>Filter by Deleted Data Assets</h2><p>Users can also search\
  \ for the soft-deleted data assets in OpenMetadata. Use the toggle bar to search\
  \ for deleted assets. The deleted data assets are read-only.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.open-metadata.org/images/v1.5/how-to-guides/discovery/deleted.png\"\
  \ alt=\"Filter by Deleted Data Assets\"></p><p>Filter by Deleted Data Assets</p><p>Users\

  description: "<p>Discovering data among thousands of datasets is hard without rich\
    \ metadata and faceted search. OpenMetadata with a single catalog aggregates metadata\
    \ about all data assets, and presents the right information to users depending\
    \ on their needs. OpenMetadata aims to help <strong>data producers</strong> make\
    \ smart decisions to evolve data and prioritize bug fixes; and help <strong>data\
    \ consumers</strong> make timely decisions with the right data.</p><p>OpenMetadata\
    \ provides a user-friendly interface for <strong>data discovery</strong>. OpenMetadata\
    \ enables you to discover your data using a variety of strategies, including:\
    \ keyword search, data associations (e.g., frequently joined tables, lineage),\
    \ and complex queries. Using OpenMetadata you can search across tables, topics,\
    \ dashboards, pipelines, ML models, containers, glossaries, and tags. OpenMetadata\
    \ supports detailed metadata for assets and their components (e.g., columns, charts),\
    \ including support for complex data types such as arrays and structs. Users can\
    \ get a complete picture of their data by viewing the <strong>data evolution</strong>\
    \ tracked using lineage and metadata versioning.</p>"

description: "<p>Discovering data among thousands of datasets is hard without rich\
  \ metadata and faceted search. OpenMetadata with a single catalog aggregates metadata\
  \ about all data assets, and presents the right information to users depending on\
  \ their needs. OpenMetadata aims to help <strong>data producers</strong> make smart\
  \ decisions to evolve data and prioritize bug fixes; and help <strong>data consumers</strong>\
  \ make timely decisions with the right data.</p><p>OpenMetadata provides a user-friendly\
  \ interface for <strong>data discovery</strong>. OpenMetadata enables you to discover\
  \ your data using a variety of strategies, including: keyword search, data associations\
  \ (e.g., frequently joined tables, lineage), and complex queries. Using OpenMetadata\
  \ you can search across tables, topics, dashboards, pipelines, ML models, containers,\
  \ glossaries, and tags. OpenMetadata supports detailed metadata for assets and their\
  \ components (e.g., columns, charts), including support for complex data types such\
  \ as arrays and structs. Users can get a complete picture of their data by viewing\
  \ the <strong>data evolution</strong> tracked using lineage and metadata versioning.</p>"

description: "Credit generally refers to your ability to borrow—the willingness of\
  \ banks and other lenders to extend a loan to you. If you have a strong credit history,\
  \ that means you have a proven track record of paying bills on time and paying your\
  \ debts. Your credit score is a measure of creditworthiness based, in part, on your\
  \ credit history. Having a higher credit score can help you qualify for a lower\
  \ interest on loans, better credit terms, larger loan amounts and higher credit\
  \ limits."
